When you are creating an item, you can change almost everything of it. 
These are the possible configurable options:  
  - Type of the item  ->  id
    https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

  - Data/Durability of the item  ->  data

  - Name of the item  ->  name

  - Lore of the item  ->  lore

  - Flags of the item, used to hide certain item value  ->  flag
    https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html

  - Enchantment of the item  ->  enchant

  - Unbreakable tag (Only for MC1.9+) ->  unbreakable

Here an example item, how you can use in the configuration file

Item:
  id: IRON_PICKAXE
  data: 0
  name: '&cCool Pickaxe'
  unbreakable: true
  lore:
  - '&6Lore line 1'
  - '&5Lore line 2'
  flag: 
  - HIDE_ATTRIBUTES
  - HIDE_ENCHANTS
  enchant: 
    #EnchantmentName#EnchantmentLevel
  - DAMAGE_ALL#1
  - DURABILITY#1

If the item you are creating is a Potion, Splash Potions or a Tipped Arrow, 
you can add extra flags to it
These are the possible value:

  - Change the Potion Effects  ->  PotionEffect
    https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html

  - Change the color (Only for MC1.11+)  ->  color
    https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Color.html

  - Potion Type (THIS IS NEEDED FOR 1.8 USERS)  ->  type
    http://docs.codelanx.com/Bukkit/1.8/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html
    Remeber that a splash potion cannot be have water potion type in 1.8

An example for 1.11 users
Potion:
  id: potion
  data: 0
  name: '&6Custom Potion'
  color: navy
  PotionEffect:
  # PotionType : PotionDuration(Second) : PotionLevel
  - DAMAGE_RESISTANCE:300:2
  - FIRE_RESISTANCE:300:1

An example for 1.8 users
Potion:
  id: potion
  data: 0
  name: '&6Custom Potion'
  type: water
  PotionEffect:
  # PotionType : PotionDuration(Second) : PotionLevel
  - DAMAGE_RESISTANCE:300:2
  - FIRE_RESISTANCE:300:1


You can also create Monster Eggs, you just need to change data to a valid monster type
For 1.11+ users https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
For 1.8 to 1.10 users http://docs.codelanx.com/Bukkit/1.8/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html

Item:
  id: monster_egg
  data: zombie
  name: '&cZombie Egg'
  lore:
    - '&7Spawn a zombie!'
  

You can also some type of NBT Tags to item. 
Remember that if you are using a plugin (For example a backpack plugin) that does
not support NBT Tags, items will break.
Right now you can add Tags for:
- AttackSpeed and Attack Damage 1.9+
- CanDestroy
- CanBePlacedOn

This is an example for adding Tags to the item
ItemAttribute:
  attackSpeed: 16 #Change the attack speed of the item
  attackDamage: 8 #Change the attack damage of the item
  canPlaceOn: 
    - lapis_block 
    - iron_block
  canDestroy:
    - lapis_block 
    - iron_block
